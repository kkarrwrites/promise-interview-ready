## QUIZZES
Let's get started.

### 1. What's the output of this code?

```js
function f1() {
    console.log('f1');
}

console.log("Let's do it!");

setTimeout(function() {console.log('in settimeout');}, 0);

f1();
f1();
f1();
f1();
```
Options are,
- Let's do it!, in settimeout, f1, f1, f1, f1
- _**Let's do it!, f1, f1, f1, f1, in settimeout**_
- Let's do it!, f1, , in settimeout, f1, f1, f1

My Explanation:
- _**console.log("Let's do it!") enters the Call Stack first and "Let's do it!" prints to the console.**_
- _**The setTimeout function enters the Call Stack and is pushed to the Callback Queue.**_
- _**The four f1 functions enter the Call Stack and run, printing "f1" to the console four times.**_
- _**The setTimeout function exits the Callback Queue and enters the Call Stack, and "in settimeout" prints to the console.**_

### 2. Which statements are `true`? Select multiple.
- [x] JavaScript is single-threaded
- [x] By default, JavaScript is synchronous
- [ ] Only promises make JavaScript asynchronous
- [ ] All function callbacks are asynchronous

My Explanation:
- _**"JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent programming language with lots of flexibility." [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-in-javascript/)**_

### 3. What's the output of the code below?

```js
function f1() {
    console.log('f1');
}

function f2() {
    console.log('f2');
}

function f3() {
    console.log('f3');
}

function f4() {
    console.log('f4');
}

console.log("Let's do it!");

setTimeout(function() {f1();}, 0);

f4();

setTimeout(function() {f2();}, 5000);

setTimeout(function() {f3();}, 3000);
```
Options are,
- _**Let's do it!, f4, f1, f3, f2**_
- Let's do it!, f1, f3, f2, f4
- Let's do it!, f1, f2, f3, f4
- Let's do it!, f1, f4, f2, f3

My Explanation:
- _**console.log("Let's do it!") enters the Call Stack first and "Let's do it!" prints to the console.**_
- _**The setTimeout function for f1 enters the Call Stack and is pushed to the Callback Queue.**_
- _**The f4 function enters the Call Stack and runs, printing "f4" to the console.**_
- _**The setTimeout function for f3 enters the Call Stack and is pushed to the Callback Queue.**_
- _**The setTimeout function for f4 enters the Call Stack and is pushed to the Callback Queue.**_
- _**The setTimeout functions exit the Callback Queue in the order in which they entered and enter the Call Stack, and "f1," "f3, and "f2" print to the console.**_

### 4. Which statement is `true`? Select Only one.
- (_) JavaScript Function Execution Stack(Call Stack) never gets empty.
- (x) The job queue gets higher priority than the callback queue.
- (_) The only job of Event Loop is to manage the Call Stack
- (_) The StackOverflow exception is random.

My Explanation:
- _**"For each loop of the event loop, one task is completed out of the callback queue." [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-in-javascript/)**_
- _**"Once that task is complete, the event loop visits the job queue. It completes all the micro tasks in the job queue before it looks into the next thing." [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-in-javascript/)**_
- _**"If both the queues got entries at the same point in time, the job queue gets preference over the callback queue." [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-in-javascript/)**_

### 5. Guess the output

```js
const tom = () => console.log('Tom');

const jerry = () => console.log('Jerry');

const cartoon = () => {
  console.log('Cartoon');

  setTimeout(tom, 5000);

  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    resolve('should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?')
  ).then(resolve => console.log(resolve))

  jerry();
}

cartoon();
```
Options are,
- _**Cartoon, Jerry, should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?, tom**_
- Cartoon, Tom, Jerry, should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?,
- Cartoon, Tom, should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?, Jerry
- Error

My Explanation:
- _**console.log("Cartoon") enters the Call Stack first and "Cartoon" prints to the console.**_
- _**The setTimeout function for tom enters the Call Stack and is pushed to the Callback Queue.**_
- _**The Promise enters the Call Stack and is pushed to the Job Queue.**_
- _**The jerry function enters the Call Stack and runs, printing "Jerry" to the console.**_
- _**The Promise enters the Call Stack and "should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?" prints to the console.**_
- _**The setTimeout function enters the Call Stack and "Tom" prints to the console.**_

### 6. Guess the output

```js
const tom = () => console.log('Tom');
const jerry = () => console.log('Jerry');
const doggy = () => console.log('Doggy');

const cartoon = () => {
  console.log('Cartoon');

  setTimeout(tom, 50);
  setTimeout(doggy, 30);

  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    resolve('I am a Promise, right after tom and doggy! Really?')
  ).then(resolve => console.log(resolve));
  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    resolve('I am a Promise after Promise!')
  ).then(resolve => console.log(resolve));

  jerry();
}

cartoon();
```
Options are,
- Cartoon, Jerry, I am a Promise, right after tom and doggy! Really?, I am a Promise after Promise!, , Tom, Doggy
- Cartoon, Jerry, I am a Promise after Promise!, I am a Promise, right after tom and doggy! Really?, Doggy, Tom

- Cartoon, Tom, Doggy, I am a Promise, right after tom and doggy! Really?, I am a Promise after Promise!, Jerry
- None of the above.
